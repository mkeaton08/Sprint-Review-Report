# Sprint-Review-Retrospective

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves actively engaging with users to understand their goals, challenges, and expectations. This can be achieved through interviews, surveys, and observations. User stories help by breaking down what the user wants into small, clear tasks. Each story explains a feature from the user's point of view, which makes it easier to build something that meets their needs.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I develop programs, I start by understanding the problem and planning how to solve it. I prefer to build and test in small steps, improving the program as I go. In the future, I want to use Agile methods like Scrum, which focus on teamwork, flexibility, and continuous improvement, to make sure the project stays on track and meets user needs.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means helping the team succeed, communicating well, and working together. It’s about sharing ideas, giving and receiving feedback, and supporting each other to overcome challenges. It also means being open to learning and improving all the time.
